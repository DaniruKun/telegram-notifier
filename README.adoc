= About

- Allow to ping all chat/group administrators

The current bot is maintained and hosted by link:https://github.com/DaniruKun[@Danirukun] and runs on Heroku.

2. Add the bot to administrators
3. Execute the `/start` command

== Running

If you decide to create your own instance, you can either:

    $ java -jar target/uberjar/telegram-notifier-standalone.jar
    
- Run with Leiningen:
    
    $ lein run

=== Environment variables

`TELEGRAM_TOKEN` - your Telegram Bot API token

== Development
